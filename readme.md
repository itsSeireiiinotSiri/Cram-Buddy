# Cram Buddy 2.2a (Unstable Alpha ver. Standalone)
Welcome to the first markdown file of the months of brain-suffering project! I will be covering a few notable things that you may want to know and I can explain.


### General websites/tools I used (at least what I can find for now XD):
##### Maven: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
##### Homebrew (Mac OS): https://brew.sh/
##### Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4535208/pocketsphinx-adding-words-and-improving-accuracy
##### Azure SDK: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk

## Pure 100% Organic Java Programmed Project
I just realized... all the dependencies issues I was suffering from were so SIMPLE to resolve by installing the ENTIRE Maven on my machine...
<p>Top 10 certified bruh moments...
</p>

## Change logs?
#### AI Implementation
#### Removed Java and Python Bridge
#### No longer a Java and Python abridged Project, just pure and holy organic dose of Java code
#### Found out that somehow the pc hates me, and having extreme difficulties to merge other clones of this project with their own versions of features into it at the time.
#### Author suffered severe depression
#### AI has almost absolute perfect voice recognition, though it needs to learn when to shut up...

## How did I make the AI work?
#### Read the example files from the SDK over and over and OVER AGAIN. Try out variety of different logic implementation, find out I nuked the project myself over and over and OVER AGAIN
#### (I honestly spent more than 6 hours per day, on this AI)

## "Do you regret doing this?"
#### A: Hell no, not in a billion years

## "Your Motto of the project?"
#### A: Try harder lmao

## "Will this be continued?"
#### A: Changes and updates will come in one after another as time goes. Will fix the issue of unable to fuse 1.4-1.9 versions of features into this first before new features come out. 

## "When will we get to see the AI fully done?"
#### A: To be announced (TBA)

## "How frequent will this receive update?"
#### A: There are no fixed cycle of time as to when I will update this project on either weekly or monthly basis. I will take as much time to ensure the quality is properly delivered, and publish once I find it satisfied to my standards.

## "I heard this project is for High School, and you recently experienced a setback for this. What happened?"
#### A: Due to technical difficulties, and unexplained reasons to why my project is unable to merge all different versions into one (and I did not have time due to tight exam timelines and etc). I had to make this standalone version with a brand new baby lousy AI that I will take my time to perfect and code as time goes. 

## "I wanna run this proj on my computer too! How to?"
#### A: Download Maven at the very least, latest OpenJDK (20), load up this project, open cmd/Terminal/Shell/Bash and cd your way into the CramMaven folder and run "mvn clean install -U". Let it sit and install all dependencies for you :>

## For Mac/possible Linux users:
#### Note that running Maven requires Maven directory to be added in the PATH of your computer. FOLLOW MAVEN INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION CLEARLY ONE BY ONE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS UP!

### Note: This is a somewhat stable version, but require ton of things in order to set up and run this project. If you have issues, run this command: "mvn clean install -U"
